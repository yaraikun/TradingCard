redo the entire program. i have a rough incomplete thing of the front end prompts
each menu has submenus, and each submenu has options and stuff. every menu or prompt has an option to use (0) to go back a menu. each menu and submenu and prompt/option should have their own respective inputter. and each inputter should have their respective input validators.

Main Menu
(0) Exit
(1) Collection (goes to Collection Menu)
(2) Binders (goes to Binders Menu)
(3) Decks (goes to Decks Menu)

Collection Menu
(0) Back (goes to Main Menu)
(1) View Collection (goes to Cards View Display and uses Cards View Input)
(2) Add New Card (prompts to input card details)
(3) Increase / Decrease Card Count (goes to Cards View Display and uses Increase Decrease Input))

Cards View Display
(0) Back
(1) Card 1
(.)
(.)
(*) Card *

Cards View Input
(0) Back (goes to Collection Menu)
(1) Card 1 (goes to Card View)
(.)
(.)
(*) Card * (goes to Card View)

Card View Display
(0) Back

Card View Input
(0) Back (goes to Cards Display + Cards View Input)

Increase Decrease Input
(0) Back (goes to Collection Menu)
(1) Card 1 (goes to Increase Decrease Prompt)
(.)
(.)
(*) Card * (goes to Increase Decrease Prompt)

Increase Decrease Prompt
(0) Cancel (goes back to Cards View + Increase Decrease Input)
(1) Increase (uses increase method)
(2) Decrease (uses decrease method)

Increase Decrease Factor Prompt
(any positive int) (uses 


Binders Menu
(0) Back
(1) View Binders
(2) Create Binder
(3) Delete Binder
(4) Trade from Binder (goes to Binders View)

(trade is basically: trade->binders view->cards view->trade prompt, or whatever)

Decks Menu
(0) Back
(1) View Decks
(2) Create Deck
(3) Delete Deck

you can probably infer the ultra structure that i am going for right here.

menu->submenu->option
menu has inputter, and validator
submenu has inputter, validator
submenus of submenu has inputter, validator
option / prompt has inputter, validator
etcetera.
